## Whoami

I’m someone who doesn’t just work in cybersecurity. I grow through it.
Every investigation, every incident and every difficult moment taught me something about myself before it taught me something technical. 
I’m naturally curious, calm under pressure and I like to understand things from the very first clue all the way to the final outcome. 

That’s where I find clarity and honestly where I feel most like myself 😊
